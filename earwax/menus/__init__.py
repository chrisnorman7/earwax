Provides all menu-related classes.

By default:

* Menus are lists of items which can be traversed with the arrow keys, or by
    searching.

* The first item can be focussed with the home key.

* The last item can be focussed with the end key.

* The selected item can be activated with the enter key.

Optionally, menus can be dismissed with the escape key.
