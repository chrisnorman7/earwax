# earwax

An audio game engine with a silly name, because the one I originally wanted isn't available.

## Installation

You can install with pip:

```python
pip install -U earwax
```

## Example

See the `example.py` file, included in this repository.

\\ Documentation

Until I can get RTD working, you can view Earwax's documentation [here](https://chrisnorman7.github.io/earwax/build/html/index.html).

## Todo

* Menus that provide sound icons.
