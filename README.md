# earwax

An audio game engine with a silly name, because the one I originally wanted isn't available.

* [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/earwax/)

* [Documentation](https://earwax.readthedocs.io/)

## Installation

You can install with pip:

```python
pip install -U earwax
```

## Example

See the `example.py` file, included in this repository.

## Building Documentation

I have just discovered that the main documentation on [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.io/) has stopped building for some reason.

Until I can get it working again, you can build the documentation yourself with the command:

```bash
python setup.py build_sphinx
```

The HTML docs will be available from `docs/build/html/index.html`.
